A community-maintained LuCI application for managing Tailscale on OpenWrt. This app provides a user-friendly web interface to view Tailscale status and configure its settings directly from LuCI.

> [!TIP]
> This application has been merged into the official OpenWrt LuCI repository. You can now install it directly via the official `opkg` source. See [openwrt/luci#8018](https://github.com/openwrt/luci/pull/8018) for details.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Recommended Version: OpenWrt 23.05 or later.

Note: This application uses `ucode` as the backend server. Older versions of OpenWrt primarily support Lua-based backends and cannot run the `ucode` backend logic used by this app.

## Features

- **Status Dashboard**:
  - View the running status of the Tailscale service.
  - Display your device's Tailscale IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
  - See your Tailnet name.
  - A detailed list of all network devices (peers), including:
    - Online/Offline status.
    - Hostname and DNS name.
    - Tailscale IPs.
    - Operating System.
    - Connection type (e.g., Direct, Relay).
    - Last seen time for offline devices.

- **Node Settings**:
  - Instantly apply settings using the `tailscale set` command without a service restart.
  - Toggle `Accept Routes`.
  - Toggle `Advertise as Exit Node`.
  - Configure `Advertise Routes`.
  - Set a specific `Exit Node` to use.
  - Toggle `Allow LAN Access` when using an exit node.
  - Enable/disable SNAT for subnet routes.
  - Enable/disable the built-in SSH server.
  - Toggle `Shields Up` mode.
  - Set a custom hostname.

- **Daemon Environment Settings**:
  - Configure environment variables for the Tailscale daemon (requires a service restart).
  - Set a custom MTU for problematic networks.
  - Enable a memory reduction mode for resource-constrained devices.

## Installation

### Method 1: Official OpenWrt Software Source (Recommended)

If you are using OpenWrt Snapshot, Master, or a future stable release (strictly version > `OpenWrt 25.12.0-rc3`), you can install it directly from the official repository:

```bash
opkg update
opkg install luci-app-tailscale-community
```

> [!TIP]
> The `tailscale` package in official OpenWrt repositories is tied to specific OpenWrt releases and does not receive updates once a version is finalized. Given Tailscale's frequent update cycle, older versions may have security vulnerabilities. For a smaller binary size and timely updates, it is highly recommended to use the [GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale](https://github.com/GuNanOvO/openwrt-tailscale/blob/main/.github/README_en.md) repository. You can easily install a high-version, optimized Tailscale package by simply importing the key and adding the custom opkg source.

### Method 2: Community Software Source (GitHub Pages)

If you are using an older version of OpenWrt or want to use the latest community-specific builds, you can add a custom repository. This method also supports automatic updates.

1.  **Add the software source**:
    Run the following commands in the router terminal:
    ```bash
    # Download and add the public key
    wget https://Tokisaki-Galaxy.github.io/luci-app-tailscale-community/all/key-build.pub -O /tmp/key-build.pub
    opkg-key add /tmp/key-build.pub
    # Add the software source
    echo "src/gz tailscale_community https://Tokisaki-Galaxy.github.io/luci-app-tailscale-community/all" >> /etc/opkg/customfeeds.conf
    # Update the list
    opkg update
    ```

2.  **Install the plugin**:
    ```bash
    opkg install luci-app-tailscale-community
    ```

> [!TIP]
> After installing this way, you can update the plugin later using `opkg upgrade luci-app-tailscale-community`.

### Method 3: Manual Installation (.ipk)

1. download the latest and stable `. ipk` software package from [Github Release](https://github.com/tokisaki-galaxy/Luci-app-tailscale-community/releases).
 - If you have special requirements, you can also download the latest `. ipk` software package for debugging purposes from [Github Actions Artifacts](https://github.com/actions).
2.  Transfer the `.ipk` file to your OpenWrt router (e.g., using `scp`).
3.  Install the package using `opkg`:

```bash
opkg install luci-app-tailscale-community_*.ipk
```

After installation, you should find the "Tailscale" menu under the "Services" tab in LuCI.

## Building from Source

You can also build the package yourself using the OpenWrt SDK. The build process is defined in the [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](.github/workflows/build.yml) file, which can be used as a reference.

1.  Clone the OpenWrt SDK.
2.  Clone this repository into the `package/` directory of the SDK.
3.  Run `make menuconfig` and select `luci-app-tailscale-community` under `LuCI` -> `Applications`.
4.  Run `make` to compile the package.
